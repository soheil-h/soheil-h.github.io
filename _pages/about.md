I am a Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering at Virginia Tech, and a research assistant at [Collab](https://collab.me.vt.edu/). My research interests include robot learning, human-robot collaboration, artificial intelligence, and robotics. I spent Spring 2023 as a research intern at [Honda Research Institute](https://usa.honda-ri.com/) working on modeling human cognitive states in hybrid mobility environments.

Previously, I did my masters in mechanical engineering at Bucknell University and worked on a research project, funded by [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/), that was focused on modeling and control of a flexible soft actuator for creating soft robotic arms.

I received my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Qazvin Azad University in 2015. From 2011 to 2017, I was a research assistant and a lead engineer at the university's [SYNTECH Technology and Innovation Center](https://www.linkedin.com/company/syntechcenter). I worked on design and implementation of tele-operative response robots. Our team actively participated in [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/) and was steadily ranked within the top 3 in [Rescue Robot League](https://rrl.robocup.org/) organized by [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/standard-test-methods-response-robots).
